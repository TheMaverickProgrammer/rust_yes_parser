# YES Script
`YES` - **Y**our **E**xtensible **S**cript .

Do you want a custom and simple file format but don't want to code the parser?
**YES** is the answer! âœ¨

YES is a meta scriplet standard whose elements, keys, and evaluation
are yours to decide. YES-defined elements can have optional **attributes**
which tag to elements in order to extend their behavior further. This has been
proven useful in products which needed to provide UGC (User Generated Content).

### Use Cases
Your data can mean anything. 
The parsing is done so the logic is up to you. 

YES-compliant parsers can be used:
  - to define [animation][BOOMFLAME] files
  - as an extended [.OBJ][WAVEFRONT] wavefront 3D model format
  - as an extended [.INI][INI] dialect
  - as a configuration file
  - to implement a scripting language
  - to represent character dialog
  - to implement a simple network protocol
  - *and more*

## Getting Started
This crate provides `YesDocParser` with two static methods:
  1. `pub fn from_file(file: &File, literals: Option<Vec<Literal>>) -> Vec<ParseResult>` 
     1. Call to parse by file
  2. `pub fn from_string(body: &str, literals: Option<Vec<Literal>>) -> Vec<ParseResult>`
     1. Call to parse by string

Even if `None` is supplied for `literals`, the parser will add a pair of
quotes for you as the first literal pair to check against while reading.

See [`Literal::build_quotes`][LITERAL_QUOTES].

#### Optional Literals
Literals are character (`u8`) pairs which instructs the parser to take every
subsequent character in the buffer from `Literal::begin` to `Literal::end`.

This allows even further extension of the format for your own documents.
For example, consider the following line:

`var x: [int] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

By providing a custom literal pair `[` and `]`, the span `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
will be stored in the argument `[int]` which then allows a programmer
to easily determine if that value is correctly notated as an integer array.

Here's how to provide a list of custom literals:

```rs
let literals = vec![Literal {begin: '[' as u8, end: ']' as u8,}];
let results = YesDocParser::from_string(content, Some(literals));

for result in result {
  // ...
}
```

#### Multiline Support
The spec is intended to be simple. 
Simple to read.
Simple to write.
Simple to parse.

Therefore newlines `\n` were chosen to denote the end of an element.
This may not appeal to programmers who are used to bracket notation
or semicolons, however non-programmers will appreciate the simplicity.

While simplicity is desired, presentation is just as important.

Elements whose line end with the backslash `\` character will defer reading
until the last line without the backslash terminator. This allows documents
to support elements with arguments which span several lines.

Example:
```js
var long_message: str="\
      apple, bananas, coconut, diamond, eggplant,\
      fig, grape, horse, igloo, joke, kangaroo,\
      lemon, notebook, mango"
```

### Simple Start
Here is a very simple example to show you how to get started:

```rs
let content = "frame duration = 1.0s , width = 10, height=20";
let results = YesDocParser::from_string(content, None);
let data = match &results.first().unwrap() {
        ParseResult::Ok {
            line_number: _,
            data: Elements::Standard { attrs: _, element },
        } => element,
        _ => panic!("Element expected!"),
    };

let duration = data.get_key_value_or("duration", "0s".to_owned());
let width = data.get_key_value_or("width", 0);
let height = data.get_key_value_or("height", 0);

assert_eq!(duration, "1.0s");
assert_eq!(width, 10);
assert_eq!(height, 20);
```

> [!WARNING]
> Be mindful and validate your own document formats!

### Deep Dive Example
See how to use the parser to read a custom config file format which enforces
document validation, positional arguments, and also contains sub-sections with 
multiple spanning properties by visiting [`examples/config.rs`][EXAMPLE].

```sh
cargo run --example config
```
