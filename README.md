# YES Script
`YES` - **Y**our **E**xtensible **S**cript .

Do you want a custom and simple file format but don't want to code the parser?
**YES** is the answer! âœ¨

YES is a meta scriplet standard whose elements, keys, and evaluation
are yours to decide. These scriplets are used for configuration files,
animation documents, tiny scripting, and then some. YES has optional 
**attribute** support to tag elements and extend their behavior further.

> [!TIP]
> - Read the [scriptlet standard][SPEC] to learn more.
> - See one of the many use cases: [animation][BOOMFLAME] files.
